      <p class="text-muted text-capitalize ">Just 22 days before my Dubai trip, I fractured my ankle and despite the harrowing reality that I may not be able to go, I somehow managed and decided to go anyway as it was our first family trip together. I went with just will power and positivity that I shall make the best of the situation. To my shock, I was shown kindness to such an extent by everyone in Dubai every stranger that I was left speechless .The staffs at Hotel Wyndham Dubai Dideira went out of their ways to assist for my accommodation. They even allowed me to take their wheelchair at places they thought would not have wheelchair assistance. My Agency “InstaDubai” did an amazing job to draw up an itinerary as per our requirements. Dubai overall is amazing destination for people who’re specially abled. 99% of their places have accommodation and infrastructure built to support us. The people there are legit super loving and caring and helpful. I fell in love with the people there for showing me with kindness. Definitely will go back again to meet same people who really touched my heart for their kindness.

      <p id="para">Gohan and Piccolo are the best duo in all of Dragon Ball and to see them get their time to shine in this was just awesome. They really did Gohan dirty in the show by turning him into the Great Sayaman and making him weak. But after seeing this I think the creators gave OG Gohan fans a great payoff. I loved the dynamic of the new android characters and look forward to seeing what they do with it going forward. The comedy bits were also hilarious and landed for me most of the time. Lastly, on the controversial topic of the animation...Let's just be real here. 3D animation allows artists to achieve what they want for much cheaper than traditional 2D animation. Yes, it does look quite different than what we're used to, But the actual quality of the 3D animation is smooth and fantastic. If they can give us more quality Dragon Ball content like this at the cost of leaving behind 2D animation then I'm all for it. Great movie!

      <p id="para">I just came back from the theatre after watching Pathaan. This is easily one of Bollywood's best action/thriller movie. SRK gave a brilliant performance. It was great to see him on the big screen after 4 years. The hand to hand combat is really well shot. The hooting from the audience for every action sequence was insane . This is probably the first time I have seen the audience hooting and cheering for a Bollywood action movie so much .John Abraham plays the no nonsense villain effortlessly. I also liked how Jim's character backstory properly explains his grudge against India . He is one of those villains how actually have a valid point .The twists and turns are really good. I really liked how this movie sets up another movie. The theme for both Jim and Pathaan is really goosebumps inducing. I also liked that Deepika's character wasn't just a mere eye candy sort of a character. Deepika also gave a great performance. I also liked that Ashutosh Rana reprised his role of Col. Luthra from War 2019. 
        Siddarth Anand did a great job as the director of this movie. The plot is really engaging. Some of the humour is kind of cringe but itncan be ignored. A must watch for SRK fans. 5/5 from my side. Thanks for reading my review.
